Acknowledgement to Professor George Ferguson for his starter sample code.

To compile the java code use the following command when in the directory:

	javac Main.java

To begin running the program use the following command:

	java Main

When running the user will recieve a prompt to choose to have all tests run immediately (not reccomended because they can get very long especially if full info is selected). Entering '0' runs all tests. Entering '1' will run the first test and then each successive test after a prompt from the user.
Next the user will be prompted to choose between seeing full info such as symtable, kb, etc. or just the query and whether it entails (the results). Entering '0' will show the full info and entering '1' will show only the results.
